Template Activity Module for Moodle
==========================
This is a more modern, and at least for me, more useful template than the others available.
It contains admin and instance settings stubs, a renderer.php and a module.js . It also contains activity completion on grade, grade book logic, backup and restore and adhoc/scheduled tasks

To Use
===========
i) Replace all instances of PYRAMID with your uppercase module name eg WIDGET
There are about 3 of these.

ii) Replace all instances of MOD_PYRAMID_ with your module frankenstyle component name eg MOD_WIDGET_
(NB note the trailing underscore. Just to be safe, include that.)
There are over 140 of these.

iii) Replace all instances of pyramid with your lowercase module name eg widget
There are over 330 of these.

iv) Replace all instances of 2020 Tom Mueller with something like "2015 Justin Hunt".
There are over 30 of these.

It is recommended to use a search and replace tool from a text editor or a command line script to do this.
Trying to do this manually is sure to lead to mistakes.

Make sure the plugin folder name, and the names of the files in these directories are also changed:
lang/en
backup/moodle2
classes/task

Copy the folder to your [Moodle program dir]/mod directory

Install as usual.

Enjoy.

NB
By default the newtemplate supports grading, but since there is nothing to grade ... yet ... when you do update a gradable item, you will need to call: [modulename]_update_grades($moduleinstance, $userid_of_student);

NB 2
If you don't want to manually rename, there is a rename.sh file in the NEWMODULE folder.
i) move that one directory up, so that it has the same directory as the NEWMODULE folder itself.
ii) make it exectuable like this ... chmod 755 rename.sh
iii) run ./rename.sh and enter the name of the plugin that should make up the frankenstyle name as directed
